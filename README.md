# NLP_Sentiment_Analysis_with_NLTK

The NLTK module is a massive tool kit, aimed at helping you with the entire Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodology. 
NLTK will aids with everything from splitting sentences from paragraphs, splitting up words, 
recognizing the part of speech of those words, highlighting the main subjects, 
and then even with helping your machine to understand what the text is all about. 

In our path to learning how to do sentiment analysis with NLTK, we're going to learn the following:

    Tokenizing - Splitting sentences and words from the body of text.
    Part of Speech tagging
    Machine Learning with the Naive Bayes classifier
    How to tie in Scikit-learn (sklearn) with NLTK
    Training classifiers with datasets
    Performing live, streaming, sentiment analysis with Twitter.
    ...and much more.
